## ✨ ✨ Building my own API testing lab ✨✨


### The Hacking Tools
So there are literally pages and pages of resources and tools you can use for hacking APIs. It took me days and continuous hours of reading every security article ever on this topic to narrow down what I'll use here.

1. Postman
For the web client I'll be using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/). In essence, Postman is just another HTTP client which can be used to easily modify and send requests to APIs. 
I saw a lot of developers raving about Postman to debug their API development process. I've found it pretty useful and it can assist with getting started with good API requests and we can get testing right away!

2. Burp Suite
For the web proxy I'll be using Burp Suite. Burp is the most comprehensive web penetration testing toolkit out there. If you are really getting serious about your API hacking tradecraft, you want the performance and capabilities of the professional edition. 

### Postman + Burp Suite = Dream TEAM
1. Open up Postman
2. Click the COG wheel on the top right side of the screen, and select Settings. In General disable “SSL certificate verification“. This will allow Postman to work with Burp’s self-signed cert used in the proxy.
3. In Proxy, disable “System Proxy” and enable “Add a custom proxy configuration“. Ensure both HTTP and HTTPS are checked, and that you have set the proxy server to localhost:8080, which points to Burp’s proxy.
4. Now start Burp
5. Back in Postman, go to an API collection you already have (or create a new request) and send it. You should see the request in the HTTP History in Burp.
6. Right-click on the history log item in Burp and select Send to Repeater.
7. Move to the Repeater tab in Burp and click the Send button. Notice you now have full control and the ability to hack the request.

### Finding the API
There are three main types of API to consider – public, partner, and private.

1. Anyone can sign up and use publc APIs for example Twitter API or Google Maps API. They tend to be well documented so they can be accessed by anyone

2. Partner APIs required to have some sort of relationship with the provider to get acccess but it's not ***completely*** hidden from the public. You may have heard of Stripe API (a payment gateway for a lot of small medium sized businesses)— there is good documentation but only available if you are a partner. 

3. Private APIs are completely hidden from the public and only accessed given explicit permissoon. They are within organisations that built its own API for internal use. Rarely will you find documentation for these APIs. If you were wanting to hack this type of API, it will require some good usage of reverse engineering. 

There are some example APIs we can use by OWASP such as the Juice Shop API and crAPI.

First I'll use a known vulnerable API to start out. 

I'll include the introduction and configuration process so you can try it out yourself. Feel free to skip to the next page to see the actual testing and reporting!

### Scoping
For whitebox and greybox tests we could have full documentation and even stock JSON request tokens for the HTTP packets. But for blackbox tests we will build our own packets using trial and errr using tools such as Postman and caputing valid requests/responses using Burp Suite as a proxy service. For demo purposes I'll be usinG Damn Vulnerable Web Service (DVWS) which a simple and easy webservice that supprots vulnerable RESTful API we can test

### Browsing 
It's unlikely you'll come across API services just from browsing a site and finding links. A good place to start is looking through API aggregators such as https://ProgrammableWeb.com to see if the target's API has been publicly documented.

Burp Suite can also come in handy here with the web spider functionality to discover API pages. Once you've opened up the target web on Burp's chromium, gain some traffic and feedback just through navigating the website manually. Click some things
Then ***right-click in Target->Site Map, add to scope*** then ***right-click -> spider this host***
Now you can look for JSON which could mean a RESTful API

Configure Postman to comunicate properly to the host API

### Using Burp Suite
Right click anywhere in the raw text and you'll see you can send it to different parts of Burp Suite. We will send it to Repeated first. Now we can leverage this feature and make slight manual adjustments according to the responses. Using the repeater tool I'll carefully examine the server's reaction to our requests and implement any minor modifcations to the packet.

Once I feel confident that I've gained a good udnerstanding of the variety of error messages and responses I'll right click on the body and 'send to intruder' where it gets interesting...
