This time I tried to see if I could at least find vulerabilities in an exisiting website.

I decided to 'attack' a website I helped develop some features. I specifically wanted to find vulnerabilities within the EZdebit API we use for payments

First I created some traffic on burp suite just browsing through the website

I was able to see all the files but interestingly because we are authenticated by logging in and given a 'token', no sensitive data is accessible

I tried scanning the ezDebit file by sending it to intruder however only through further authentication is anything available, which I did not access

Good security 👍👍👍👍
